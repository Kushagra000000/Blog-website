  <p class="author__body">
    Hi, I'm <strong>Kushagra</strong>, a software enginnering student studying at UNSW.
    This blog is where I record short notes from my coursework, small projects (like this one) and other random stuff.
    Aims:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Document what I learn</strong> — writing helps me remember.</li>
    <li><strong>Share small projects</strong> — short project summaries and links to code on GitHub so others can re-use them (haven't worked on a useful project yet).</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with web dev</strong> — this site itself is a learning project: Express + file storage, uploads, and simple auth and self hosting.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="author__body">
    I also plan to publish a small highlights gallery, links to repositories for projects I complete, and other random cool links about things I found interesting.
  </p>
